      <h2>PIM's Maze</h2>
      <h3>Welcome!</h3>
      <p>
        This project generates a maze using pim's algorithm. Soon you will be
        able to click through the maze to try to solve it! You stat at the green
        square and your goal is the red square.
      </p>

      <h3>Pim's Algorithm</h3>
      <p>The algorithm generates a list of potential next spots to expand the maze. We then select one at random. This process repeats until the play area is filled.</p>

      <h3>How to play</h3>
      <p>Try to get through the maze without going diagonally, only one the gray squares. Start at green and end at red.</p>
